Polynomial Regression Feature Selection Analysis
===========================================

1. Comparison of Selected Features Across Methods:
------------------------------------------------
a) Backward Elimination:
   - Selected 18 features
   - Retained most polynomial terms
   - Notably excluded: Temperature(°C)^2 and Material Transformation Metric^2
   - Kept most interaction terms between variables

b) Forward Selection & Bidirectional Selection:
   - Both methods selected identical 3 features:
     * Material Transformation Metric^2
     * Temperature (°C) Material Transformation Metric
     * Material Transformation Metric
   - Much more selective than backward elimination
   - Focus on Material Transformation Metric and its interactions

c) Keep All Variables:
   - Used all 21 features (including polynomial and interaction terms)
   - Serves as baseline for comparison

2. Performance Comparison with Full Model:
----------------------------------------
R² and Adjusted R² scores:

Method                  R²       Adjusted R²
-----------------------------------------------
Backward Elimination    0.8745   0.8740  (Best)
Forward Selection      0.8045   0.8044
Bidirectional         0.8045   0.8044
Keep All Variables    0.8568   0.8561

Key Observations:
- Backward Elimination performed best despite using fewer features than full model
- Forward and Bidirectional methods showed identical performance
- Full model (Keep All Variables) performed better than Forward/Bidirectional but worse than Backward
- The difference between R² and Adjusted R² is smallest for Forward/Bidirectional, indicating good balance between complexity and performance

3. Feature Selection Patterns:
----------------------------
1. Material Transformation Metric appears important in all methods
2. Forward and Bidirectional methods prefer simpler models with focus on strongest predictors
3. Backward Elimination retains more complex interactions while still improving on full model
4. Temperature and its interactions appear significant across methods

Conclusion:
----------
- Backward Elimination provides the best balance of complexity and performance
- The similarity between Forward and Bidirectional results suggests strong individual predictors
- The full model's lower performance compared to Backward Elimination indicates some features may introduce noise
- Material Transformation Metric and its interactions are consistently important predictors
